# Offers


Assumptions:
- If you want to manually cancel an offer, you want to delete it from the database.
- Simplificaton: I'm using a embedded database so the data is only kept when the application is running. For a production application, this will need to be changed.
- The date is entered in that format: dd/MM/yyyy


## How to run: 

```sh 
$ mvn clean install
```

```sh
$ mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring.profiles.active=localhost
```


### Add or update a product:

   Body:

   ```

##To do:
- [ ] Not null not working - validation of request/response + tests
- [X] Add screenshots to README
- [X] Add the automatic expiration
- [ ] Change from date to # of days
- [ ] Preload database with example products
- [ ] Edge cases
- [ ] Cancellation/Delete? Remove assumption there? 




Open the H2 console by typing in http://localhost:8080/h2-console in the browser address bar.
change the Database URL to jdbc:h2:mem:testdb in the login screen as this is the default URL configured by Spring Boot.
